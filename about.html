                        <p> His idea for Heartbeat began In 2013 when he co-founded Wyldfire, the first female-focused dating app designed to deliver a better and safer mobile experience for women. Through the experience, he found how much power smaller influencers
                            had in promoting the dating app. He knew then and there that it was those kinds of voices he needed to cultivate. Not too long after, in 2016, Heartbeat was born. </p>
                        <p> In addition to his role as CEO of Heartbeat, he is a regular contributor for Adweek, Forbes, MarketWatch, Business Insider, Inc, and has been featured in the Wall Street Journal.</p>
